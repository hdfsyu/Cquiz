# Cquiz

So i'm planning to add more languages, but eh, won't do it right now.

# Running

You can't "compile" it but in order to run it just type (in the project's directory) `node index.js`
or, simply just type `npm cquiz` in your terminal.

# About

This is just a simple quiz about the programming language C
I might add more languages too it and make a language selector, but eh, who knows?
