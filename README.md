# Cquiz

So i'm planning to add more languages, but eh, won't do it right now.

# Running

You can't "compile" it but in order to run it just type (in the project's directory) `node index.js`

or, simply just type `npm --global i cquiz` in your terminal.

if you're typing `npm --global i cquiz`,

you also need to install dependencies, to install dependencies type ```npm --global i chalk inquirer gradient-string chalk-animation figlet nanospinner```

(for all the npm commands, on linux you have to add `sudo` to the start of it)

# About

This is just a simple quiz about the programming language C

I might add more languages too it and make a language selector, but eh, who knows?
